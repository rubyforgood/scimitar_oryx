Let's be honest, we all want to do great things. What is better than being part of a group that is helping to bring a species that is extinct in the wild back? There are captive populations of the oryx on ranches in Texas that researchers need some help with. They need a centralized database to keep track of the oryx, things like numbers, breeding history (can't let them get inbred), and so on. Once a stable gene pool and other information can be established, researchers are hoping to re-introduce them into the wild!

### MVP
- Profiles
- Basic Search
- Basic Matching
- [Full Registry Fields Listing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-fwmE4fYazKSXJEQTNuNzNjR0duemNtdHhJOGk0RUVxTFNR/view?usp=sharing)

### Preliminary Draft Requirements
#### Overview
- Expansion of the Source Population Alliance (scimitar-horned oryx population et al) landowner network-
  - Similar structure to animal registry sites like http://www.angus.org/, https://aqha.com/services
- Integrate with the data collection portal developed for Loggerhead Shrike
  - Standardized data format between projects
- Ideally this registry data/animal profiles would be able to interact with each other similar to a dating site using genomics data if available (i.e. this animal or herd and this animal or herd are a - % match) and can send an automatic email when a participant is interested in a trade
  - Use provided genetics data to determine match %
- Search functionality
  - Simple search based on attribute filters (see below)
- Ability to download data into excel spreadsheet

#### Create a page with privacy settings
- Hide sensitive info from public access
- Looking to be contacted vs. not looking (opt-in)

#### Institutional/ ranch or individual profile
- Species types
- Number of animals in herds
- Broken down by demographics
- Member status
- Location and contact information

#### Animal registration
- Photos
- Description
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Reproductive Status
- Interests
  - Sell
  - Trade
  - Sell or Trade in X years
  - Looking for mate
  - Keep
- Breeding reports and certificate release?
- Genetics/genomics testing
- Photographs of space/ facilities

#### Space/ facilities registration
- Description
  - Size
  - Characteristics
- Interests
  - Seeking retirement animals (in search of)

#### Stretch Goals
- Option for Full Circle Enroll? https://www.aqha.com/membership/resources/advocacy/full-circle/
  - Receive notification of closed ranches to previous owner
- Data visualization dashboard?

#### Design
- Some branding guidelines around logo, etc.
